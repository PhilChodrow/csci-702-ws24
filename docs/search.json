    "text": "Writing in \\(\\LaTeX\\)\n\\(\\LaTeX\\) (“LAH-tek”) is the technical typesetting software used broadly across the quantitative sciences. The vast majority of papers in computer science, mathematics, physics, and engineering are composed with \\(\\LaTeX\\). If you’ve ever taken a math class here at Middlebury, I guarantee that you have interacted with many documents produced using \\(\\LaTeX\\).\nYou will create most of your written deliverables for this course using \\(\\LaTeX\\). I recommend two ways to do this. You can pick a different way, but I recommend doing this only if you are exceptionally comfortable with your software and have already formed distinctive preferences about \\(\\LaTeX\\).\n\nOverleaf is an online service that gives free access to collaborative \\(\\LaTeX\\) document preparation. You can create a free account, supply a template, and immediately begin editing.\nYou can also edit \\(\\LaTeX\\) on your local machine. For example, VSCode offers an excellent extension for \\(\\LaTeX\\) editing called LaTeX Workshop. In order to compile documents locally, you will need to download the \\(\\LaTeX\\) typesetting software itself onto your local machine.\n\nMany other text editors have similar extensions or functionality for working with \\(\\LaTeX\\) documents. I mention VSCode specifically because (a) you may have some exposure to it already and (b) it is my personal choice.\n\n\nIf you like easy solutions, choose Overleaf. If you love your editor or being fully in control of your own software, choose a local installation."

    "text": "Thesis Proposal Presentation\nYour thesis proposal presentation includes two deliverables:\n\nProposal Presentation Outline\nYour thesis proposal presentation is an 11-slide, 11-minute presentation in which you describe your research question, summarize your achievements so far, and describe what you will do next. You can think of it as a synthesis of What?, Why?, with aspects that look both forward and backward. Unlike the previous presentations we’ve done in this class, this presentation should be structured and professional. We’ll be inviting the CS faculty to attend your proposal presentation.\nBecause the proposal is a more formal presentation, I am going to ask you to outline it ahead of time. Your outline should be based on the strategy described in Part 1 of these slides by Dan Larremore. In particular, your outline (and your slides) should be structured exactly as:\n\nTitle\nIntro: entice audience. This is probably the right place to explain the problem and why it is important.\nIntro: hook audience (now they are fully paying attention). This is a good place to expand on the importance of the problem, describe what has been done before, and hint at the secret sauce that is going to make you successful.\nOutline: what content you are about to share with them.\n[Results]\n[Results]\n[Results]\n[Results]\nSummary: remind the audience of what you’ve shared so far.\nOutline of plans for the spring semester: what do you need to do and how will you do it?\nThanks + acknowledgements.\n\nEach of these slides needs to be relatively simple: you should plan to spend approximately 1 minute on each (possibly less on title slide and thanks + acknowledgments).\nYour outline can be an entry in your reflection journal on Overleaf. Submit a PDF on Canvas.\nRequired Outline Components\n\n1-2 sentences describing the idea of your project. What will folks say when they are asked what your talk was about?\nA few sentences describing what you know about your audience and how you will factor that knowledge into your presentation strategy. (Note: your audience is your classmates + CS faculty)\nFor each of your 11 slides, write a sentence that describes the purpose of the slide (motivating the topic, explaining a preliminary result, describing an approach, summarizing what has been learned). Your sentences should be unique and specific in the context of your project.\n\nSo, “In this slide, I will hook the audience” is not unique or specific.\n“In this slide, I will highlight the gap in scholarship about X and hint that I am going to use Y to address this.”\n\n\n\n\nProposal Presentation\nYour proposal presentation should be a set of professional, polished slides that implement the outline you submitted above. Before crafting your presentation, please take time to completely read through these slides by Dan Larremore. A few simple points are especially important:\n\nAll figures need to have axis labels and a message that contributes to the purpose of the slide.\nNo small fonts.\nExactly 11 slides, timed for exactly 11 minutes. Practice ahead of time!\n\nThat said, the more you adapt from Dan’s guidance, the better your presentations will be.\nSubmit a PDF of your slides on Canvas and be ready to present in class!"

    "section": "Thesis Proposal Document",
    "text": "Thesis Proposal Document\nYour thesis proposal is a written version of your proposal presentation. You can think of it as the capstone deliverable for CSCI 0702 in W24. It should include the following sections:\n\nAbstract: Give a concise, one-paragraph summary of your proposal document.\nIntroduction: Describe the problem you aim to solve and why it’s important. This is a good place to cite “big picture” papers that don’t necessarily address your problem but do underscore why it matters. You can also close this section with a paragraph describing what you are going to do and how it is promisingly different from what has been done before.\nRelated Work: Give a written overview of prior literature that addresses your problem or related versions of your problem.\nMethods: Describe your approach to your problem – algorithms, math, software frameworks, experiments.\nResults: Describe the results of your work so far. This is a good place to include appropriately labeled figures with discussion, as well as tables and other artifacts produced from your findings so far. Your focus in this section should be on ensuring that the reader understands what the results literally mean and how they relate to each other. Questions of importance or big-picture framing are for the following section.\nDiscussion: Describe the significance and limitations of your results. Here is the place to emphasize the importance of your results in the context of your overall research motivation.\nFuture Work: Describe the gap between what you’ve achieved so far and what you’ve set out to do. What’s left? Describe your plan for the remainder of your work, your vision of full success, and a possible “partial success” scenario that would still allow you to addres the primary motivation of your project.\n\n\nSpecifications\n\nPlease include all of the sections above, in the described order.\nYour proposal should be 4-6 single-spaced pages (or 8-12 double-spaced pages), not including references.\nRelated, please use appropriate citations in LaTeX and generate a references section.\nProposals are a polished, professional written artifact. They should therefore be drafted and revised!\nWriting tactics:\n\nNo weasel words.\nWhen structuring a results section, I often find it helpful to generate my figures (and captions) first, and then build my story around them.\nYour story is a narrative of your scientific findings, not of the work you did to get them. If you spent a lot of time on something that ultimately didn’t work out, you should spend at most a few sentences in your proposal explaining what you did, why it didn’t work, and how that’s relevant to what did work."

The gold standard for precision in quantitative science is the language of mathematics and algorithms.

Your plans may change and you may deviate from your outline as you go—that’s fine—but you should do so with intention and purpose.\n\nPlease read the descriptions and scaffolding for each of the five sections described in Section 3.2.\nYour outline should include each of these sections, along with a list of 3-5 bullet-point sentences describing what you will communicate to your reader. Together, these sentences form an “abstract” of the section.\n\nThese should be complete sentences, not phrases, each of which makes a claim that advances the arc of your thesis.\n\nBelow each sentence, please include references to what you will use to support the claim. These could be literature references; references to a figure you will create; etc. It’s ok to skip these references for the methods and discussion sections.\n\nSubmit your outline as a PDF on Canvas.\n\nExample 1\nThis example is from a hypothetical literature review section.\n\nAlthough the question of fairness in machine learning is very important, there is no consensus on which definitions of fairness should be used in different application areas.\n\nBarocas, Hardt, and Narayanan (2023)\n\nFurthermore, some of these definitions of fairness are incompatible with each other.\n\nChouldechova (2017), Corbett-Davies et al. (2017), Kleinberg, Mullainathan, and Raghavan (2016)\n\nOne source of bias is failure to carefully specify the target variable and ensure that the target is appropriately reflective of the goal of the predictive model.\n\nObermeyer et al. (2019)\n\n…\n\n\n\nExample 2\nThis example is from a hypothetical results section.\n\nAcross several different tasks, our proposed algorithm performs slightly better than existing state of the art (SOTA).\n\nTable 1 showing task descriptions, our performance, SOTA performance, and timings.\n\nOur proposed algorithm also performs well on a broader range of tasks than are feasible with SOTA.\n\nTable 2 showing our algorithm working on examples where SOTA can’t even be run.\n\nAlthough our algorithm generates overall higher-quality solutions, the resulting solutions are not as easily interpretable or intuitive as SOTA.\n\nFigure 1 showing our algorithm output in comparison to SOTA.\n\n…"

By the end of your introduction, the reader should understand what your problem is, why it’s important, why you need to work on it, what your overall approach is, and what to expect as they continue reading.\n\n\nLiterature Review\nA reasonable target for your literature review is 6-8 double-spaced pages, not including references. A fair target for a literature review is around 30 references discussed, and 20 would be a minimum. You may deviate from this with the consent of your thesis advisor. Literature review sections are often titled “Related Work.”\nYour literature review is a survey of literature related to your topic. Your literature review should discuss a range of scholarly references and highlight their importance to your problem or related ideas.\nOne way to think about what you should include: your topic is probably an intersection of several ideas. For example, if my topic is “modified gradient descent for fairness-penalized classification models,” then my topic is the intersection of:\n\nGradient descent algorithms\nFairness in machine learning\nPenalty methods in optimization\nClassification models\n\nIt would be appropriate for my literature review to discuss sources in all of these areas, though not necessarily in that order.\nIt is often, but not always, appropriate for the introduction and literature review to contain illustrative diagrams to help your reader understand what it is that we are talking about and why so many people care about it. For the final thesis, these diagrams should be created by you, and not copied (even with attribution) from other sources.\n\nWriting Style for Literature Reviews\n\nIt’s easy to say have sentences like “Barocas, Hardt, and Narayanan (2023) discuss the importance of fairness in machine learning” over and over. Avoid this! Instead, use active verbs and specific claims or ideas. “Barocas, Hardt, and Narayanan (2023) argue that fairness in machine learning is multifaceted and demonstrate how different formulations are appropriate in different contexts.” Some other good phrases are: proves that, shows, formulates/invents, criticizes, improves ____ by doing ____, etc.\nIn \\(\\LaTeX\\), you can use \\cite{source1, source2} to cite multiple sources simultaneously.\nIn scientific writing, we very rarely quote. Instead, paraphrase and cite.\nIt’s most common to simply write a sentence about a matter of fact and then cite, e.g. “Fairness in machine learning is a multifaceted topic (Barocas, Hardt, and Narayanan 2023).” It’s also fine to use the authors as the subject of the sentence, e.g. “Barocas, Hardt, and Narayanan (2023) argue that fairness in machine learning is multifaceted.” It’s best to do this relatively rarely.\n\n\n\n\nMethods\nA reasonable target for your methods section is 8-12 double-spaced pages, not including references. The necessary length of this section can be highly variable and you should consult with your advisor about what target length might be right for you.\nYour methods section is where you should describe the details of what exactly you are doing. This is the place for algorithms, equations, and descriptions of experimental protocols.\n\nMath and Algorithms\nUse them! Correctly incorporating mathematics and algorithms into your scientific writing is largely a matter of defining your terms. Here’s an example equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    R(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{y}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\ell(f(\\mathbf{x}_i), y_i)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nThis equation does not mean anything. That’s because it has a bunch of symbols that haven’t been defined yet. Every mathematical symbol needs to be explicitly defined, usually in the body of the text.  In this example, I would display the equation above and then immediately follow it with something like this:It’s not a big problem if the symbol is defined much earlier in the text, as long as you are giving the reader occasional reminders to help them remember what means what.\n\nEquation 1 defines the empirical risk function \\(R\\). In this equation, \\(n\\) is the number of distinct data points, \\(p\\) is the number of features, \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) is the matrix of predictor data and \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is a vector of targets. The function \\(\\ell\\) is the loss function and \\(f\\) is the predictor function.\n\nYou should similarly use algorithms – with carefully-defined mathematical symbols – to express your ideas. Your aim should be that your reader could with patience reimplement exactly your own methods, without needing to “guess” at any of the mathematical or algorithmic choices you made along the way.\n\n\nDescribe Experiments\nThe methods section is also a good place to describe how you test your algorithm/model/implementation/protocol, but not what the results are. Things that should go in here may include:\n\nThe conditions of your computational experiments: number of steps, size of problem, etc.\nA mathematical description of what you are measuring in those experiments; e.g. error, variance, mean, runtime, etc. In many cases it is useful to measure multiple things; e.g. error and runtime both.\nThe specs of the machine on which you did those experiments.\nHow you designed and administered a user survey; how you incorporated feedback from the survey into your product; etc.\nAny competitors (algorithms, products, etc.) that you compared to yours, and a description of how you made the comparison. If these are published, then you don’t usually need to go into detail – just the name of the competitor and a citation is fine.\n\n\n\n\nResults\nA reasonable target for your results section is 6-10 double-spaced pages, not including references. The necessary length of this section can be highly variable and you should consult with your advisor about what target length might be right for you.\nThis is where we show that your innovation is Good, Actually. Your results section is the place to tell your reader about the outcomes of your experiments; the feedback that you received; etc. The exact structure of the results section depends on the kinds of results you have to share and how you present them, and so a major undertaking for the results section is simply the design of effective scientific graphics and tables.  Figures are often best for showing big-picture patterns, while tables are most relevant when it is important for your reader to compare two specific numbers (for example, the error achieved by your algorithm vs. the error achieved by a competitor).I personally find that it is often easiest for me to focus on designing graphics; then populate the results section with the graphics in the correct sequence; and then write “around” the graphics.\nRemember that no figures or tables speak for themselves; it is your job to write captions and paragraph discussions. Captions are for ensuring that the reader is technically able to understand all the symbols and markings in the figures, while paragraph discussions are for telling the story.\nYour results section is a good place to comment on comparisons (“Our algorithm was faster than the competitor by approximately 1 order of magnitude while achieving similar error.”). It’s not the right place to comment on the significance of this (“this is a big deal for users”); that’s for the Discussion section.\n\n\nDiscussion\nA reasonable target for your discussion section is 5-7 double-spaced pages, not including references. The necessary length of this section can be highly variable and you should consult with your advisor about what target length might be right for you.\nThe Discussion section is your closing interaction with your reader. It’s where you and they reflect on what you’ve done. The main questions you should address in the discussion are:\n\nConcisely, what exactly did we do again?\nIn what ways did it work? In what ways did it not work?\nWhy does it matter?\nWhat’s the next logical scientific step suggested by this work (i.e. what should your advisor’s next thesis student work on?)"

Demonstrate the use of \\cite, \\textcite, and \\fullcite to generate citations. Check that the citations appear in your text as well as in the “References” section.\n\n\nCross-References\nCreate another subsection called “Cross-References”.\nFirst, label the equation that you wrote in the previous section. For example, you could label it eq:first-eq. Then, use the command \\cref{eq:first-eq} to generate a cross-reference to this equation in the text of your document. Now you can talk about the equation and your readers will know exactly which one you are talking about!!\nNow let’s make a figure. Your figure must have a figure number (e.g. “Figure 1”) and a caption. Creating a figure in \\(\\LaTeX\\) is a little complex. You will need to create a figure environment, then place a graphic inside that environment, and then add the caption. Your graphic is a file (like .png or .jpeg that can live in a separate folder on Overleaf.)\nNext, give the figure a label which will allow you to refer back to it.

I expect all students to contribute to a healthy course environment.\nWe embrace diversity of age, background, beliefs, race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, gender expression, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, and other apparent and non-apparent axes of identity. Discrimination is not tolerated in CSCI 0200. Discriminatory speech or acts may lead to engagement with the Community Standards Office.\nYou deserve to be addressed in the manner that reflects who you are. I welcome to tell me your pronouns and/or chosen name at any time, either in person or via email. I expect all students to address each other according to their expressed gender markers, and commit to doing the same.\nYou deserve to fully and equitably participate in our learning environment. I commit to ensuring that the materials and assessments in this course are accessible to all students, and I welcome feedback on where I can do better. Middlebury’s Disability Resource Center can help you remove barriers to learning in this and other courses.\nYou deserve a learning environment free from gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. If you experience these behaviors or otherwise know of a Title IX violation, you have many options for support and/or reporting. Middlebury’s Civil Rights and Title IX Office (CRTIX) can help you navigate your options. Please be aware that I am a Responsible Employee, which means that I am required by the College to report incidents of sexual harassment or sexual violence to CRTIX. There are resources for emotional and mental health care, advocacy, and academic support listed here, some of which are confidential."

    "text": "We Can Help You Borrow a Laptop\nAn especially important resource for access in many courses in the Department of Computer Science is a functioning laptop. If you ever find yourself temporarily in need of a laptop, we have 10 rotating Windows laptops that we can loan you. To request a laptop for short-term use (like a single class period), email me as soon as possible.\nOn Long-Term Use: College policy has changed recently to include the expectation that every student have a laptop available. The college provides laptops to those who need them where “need” is based on Student Financial Services calculations. If you anticipate needing a laptop for the whole term, we encourage you to inquire with Student Financial Services and the library first due to our smaller pool of equipment. If, however, the College will not be able to meet your needs in a timely fashion, please reach out to us so that we can work out a long-term laptop loan."

    "section": "About ChatGPT",
    "text": "About ChatGPT\n\nWhat Is It?\nChatGPT is an example of a large language model (LLM). LLMs aim to produce helpful, human-like text with a combination of two major mechanisms:\n\nLLMs use next-token prediction to predict the next entries in a sequence of text by using the previous entries. This enables them to mimic human-produced text. So, if you saw the sequence “I love Math Foundations of _____”, you might guess that the next word might be “Computing” and that it’s probably not “Pineapples.”\nLLMs are trained using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to produce sentences that are not just realistic but also helpful, nonoffensive, or accurate. They do this using a multistage training process that involves humans rating the quality of candidate texts.\n\nChatGPT and similar LLMs are shaping many conversations in education at Middlebury and beyond.\nWhile LLMs may have many benefits, they are also the subject of routine deception by powerful, motivated actors. They are powered by massive quantities of low-paying, traumatizing labor. LLMs and automation more generally are furthering labor instability, contributing to reduced wages, and are concentrating the power of a small number of large tech companies.\n\n\nIn This Class\n\nWork that you submit in this class must demonstrate your learning and understanding. Copy/paste from LLMs like ChatGPT does not do this, and is consequently a violation of academic integrity.\nYou are free to consult ChatGPT (or other LLMs) when troubleshooting, writing code, etc. If you do, you must treat ChatGPT as an unverified source. This means:\n\nYou must cite your source.\nYou must describe the contribution of the source to your submitted writeup.\nYou may paraphrase but may not quote ChatGPT.\nYou must describe what steps you have taken to check that your learning involving ChatGPT is indeed correct.\n\nYou are always personally responsible for the accuracy, quality, and integrity of your work."
