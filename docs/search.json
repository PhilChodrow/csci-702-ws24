Students will spend the semester researching and writing, and developing and experimenting as appropriate for their topic. All students will be expected to report on their work in the form of a written thesis, a poster, and an oral presentation at the end of the semester. In addition, throughout the semester, students will meet as a group to discuss research and writing, and will be expected to attend talks in the Computer Science lecture series. Before approval to join the class is granted, students are expected to have chosen a thesis adviser from the CSCI faculty, and determined a thesis topic with the guidance and approval of that adviser."

The college provides laptops to those who need them where “need” is based on Student Financial Services calculations. If you anticipate needing a laptop for the whole term, we encourage you to inquire with Student Financial Services and the library first due to our smaller pool of equipment. If, however, the College will not be able to meet your needs in a timely fashion, please reach out to us so that we can work out a long-term laptop loan."

    "section": "About ChatGPT",
    "text": "About ChatGPT\n\nWhat Is It?\nChatGPT is an example of a large language model (LLM). LLMs aim to produce helpful, human-like text with a combination of two major mechanisms:\n\nLLMs use next-token prediction to predict the next entries in a sequence of text by using the previous entries. This enables them to mimic human-produced text. So, if you saw the sequence “I love Math Foundations of _____”, you might guess that the next word might be “Computing” and that it’s probably not “Pineapples.”\nLLMs are trained using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to produce sentences that are not just realistic but also helpful, nonoffensive, or accurate. They do this using a multistage training process that involves humans rating the quality of candidate texts.\n\nChatGPT and similar LLMs are shaping many conversations in education at Middlebury and beyond.\nWhile LLMs may have many benefits, they are also the subject of routine deception by powerful, motivated actors. They are powered by massive quantities of low-paying, traumatizing labor. LLMs and automation more generally are furthering labor instability, contributing to reduced wages, and are concentrating the power of a small number of large tech companies.\n\n\nIn This Class\n\nWork that you submit in this class must demonstrate your learning and understanding. Copy/paste from LLMs like ChatGPT does not do this, and is consequently a violation of academic integrity.\nYou are free to consult ChatGPT (or other LLMs) when troubleshooting, writing code, etc. If you do, you must treat ChatGPT as an unverified source. This means:\n\nYou must cite your source.\nYou must describe the contribution of the source to your submitted writeup.\nYou may paraphrase but may not quote ChatGPT.\nYou must describe what steps you have taken to check that your learning involving ChatGPT is indeed correct.\n\nYou are always personally responsible for the accuracy, quality, and integrity of your work."

You can even just reference sampleThesis.bib in the Overleaf, which does not require you to make any new files.\n\nDeclare that you are going to use the biblatex package.\nThen, add your .bib file as a bibliography resource.\nArrange to print your bibliography at the end of the document.\n\nNow we are ready to start citing! Demonstrate the use of \\cite, \\textcite, and \\fullcite to generate citations. Check that the citations appear in your text as well as in the “References” section.\n\n\nCross-References\nCreate another subsection called “Cross-References”.\nFirst, label the equation that you wrote in the previous section. For example, you could label it eq:first-eq. Then, use the command \\cref{eq:first-eq} to generate a cross-reference to this equation in the text of your document. Now you can talk about the equation and your readers will know exactly which one you are talking about!!\nNow let’s make a figure. Your figure must have a figure number (e.g. “Figure 1”) and a caption. Creating a figure in \\(\\LaTeX\\) is a little complex. You will need to create a figure environment, then place a graphic inside that environment, and then add the caption. Your graphic is a file (like .png or .jpeg that can live in a separate folder on Overleaf.)\nNext, give the figure a label which will allow you to refer back to it. For example, you could label it fig:first-fig. Finally, in the text in this section, use the command \\cref{fig:first-fig} to generate a cross-reference to this figure, in which ou say something about it.\nTo do this part, you will need to use more packages: hyperref, cleverref, and graphicx. Some people (like me) think that the default hyperref settings are a little ugly. You can hide links by choosing the optional hidelinks=true argument when declaring the use of hyperref. hyperref must be declared before cleverref."

    "text": "Writing in \\(\\LaTeX\\)\n\\(\\LaTeX\\) (“LAH-tek”) is the technical typesetting software used broadly across the quantitative sciences. The vast majority of papers in computer science, mathematics, physics, and engineering are composed with \\(\\LaTeX\\). If you’ve ever taken a math class here at Middlebury, I guarantee that you have interacted with many documents produced using \\(\\LaTeX\\).\nYou will create most of your written deliverables for this course using \\(\\LaTeX\\). I recommend two ways to do this. You can pick a different way, but I recommend doing this only if you are exceptionally comfortable with your software and have already formed distinctive preferences about \\(\\LaTeX\\).\n\nOverleaf is an online service that gives free access to collaborative \\(\\LaTeX\\) document preparation. You can create a free account, supply a template, and immediately begin editing.\nYou can also edit \\(\\LaTeX\\) on your local machine. For example, VSCode offers an excellent extension for \\(\\LaTeX\\) editing called LaTeX Workshop. In order to compile documents locally, you will need to download the \\(\\LaTeX\\) typesetting software itself onto your local machine.\n\nMany other text editors have similar extensions or functionality for working with \\(\\LaTeX\\) documents. I mention VSCode specifically because (a) you may have some exposure to it already and (b) it is my personal choice.\n\n\nIf you like easy solutions, choose Overleaf. If you love your editor or being fully in control of your own software, choose a local installation."
