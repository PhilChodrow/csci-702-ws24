title: Thesis Proposal
---

By the end of Winter Term, you will write a **thesis proposal**. This proposal describes the work that you have already done, the work that you will do in the spring, and the overall scientific accomplishment that your thesis will represent. Your thesis proposal is proof that you *have a plan* for completing an interesting and high-quality project. 

During Winter term, we'll work on your thesis proposal through a sequence of assignments. 

## What? 

Please create a very short presentation of **3 slides** (not including your title slide). You should have one slide that addresses each of the following questions: 

1. What is the thing that I am going to do?
2. Why am **I** interested in or excited about that? 
    - *Note: at this point, you don't have to justify why anyone* ***else*** *should be interested in or excited about it.*
3. If I am completely successful, what would the outcome of my work be? 


You should expect that your in-class presentation will take no longer than 5 minutes. 

**Please do** use graphics, diagrams, and technical language used in the area in which you are studying.  

**Please don't** worry about the question of "why is this important?" We'll address that question in a future presentation. 



**Submit a PDF of your slides on Canvas and be ready to present in class!** 

## Why? 

Now it's time to clearly state the "*why?*" of your work. Please create a brief presentation of 5 slides (not including your title slide). Each of your slides should address one of the following sets of questions:


1. What is the thing that I am going to do? (*This can be a revision of slides in your "What?" presentation.*)
2. Why should people care about that thing getting done? 
3. What previous work exists that has attempted to solve my problem, or closely-related problems?
4. What is the "gap" in this work? Why is there still more work left to do in this area?
5. What's my angle? What's the idea or secret sauce that makes me believe that I can address this gap in a useful way? 

**Submit a PDF of your slides on Canvas and be ready to present in class!**
